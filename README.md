# CVS Coding Challenge

Search and display photos from flickr.

## Description

This app allows the user to search flickr for photos and display them along with their metadata. It demonstrates calling an API to receive the photos, displaying them using a scrollable vgrid in SwiftUI and navigating to a detail view. The description is formatted html which is displayed using a WKWebView using UIViewRepresentable. Voice over support is provided along with partial support for landscape orientation. Unit tests are included.
